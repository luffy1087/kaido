# kaido
**kaido** is a framework for bdd tests based on selenium WebDriverJs.

This project is currently in progress and I hope it'll be full-developed as soon as possible.

If you want to have a look at the project; the first thing to do is downloading all of the dependencies used by kaido making it be out-of-the-box
